        <p class="descr">Drawing is a passion that has taken a significant place in the lives of many artists. For some, it is a way to escape
        the daily grind, while for others, it is a way to express their creativity and imagination. For me, drawing has become
        much more than just a passion. It is a means of expressing myself and letting my creativity flow. </p>

                I discovered drawing during the lockdown when I started looking for an activity to occupy my free time. At first, my
                drawings were far from perfect, but I persevered because I loved the idea of creating something with my own hands. I
                mainly drew manga characters because I really like that universe.
                
                Over time, I began to improve and enhance my level. I started enjoying drawing more and more and began spending more
                time on it. I quickly realized that drawing was much more than just a hobby for me, it had become a true passion.
                
                That's when I decided to invest in a graphics tablet so that I could draw directly on my computer.
    
            </p>
    
            <p class="descr">
                I found this method of drawing very enjoyable and intuitive, and I was able to progress quickly thanks to the tools
                available on the tablet. Drawing on a graphics tablet has become my favorite method because it allows me to experiment
                and try new things more easily than with just a pencil and paper.
                
                Today, I am proud of my drawings and my level. Of course, there is still much to learn and perfect, but I am happy to
                see all the progress I have made since my beginnings. Drawing has become an integral part of my life, an endless source
                of pleasure and creativity. I am convinced that this passion will never leave me, and that I will continue to draw for a
                long time.
