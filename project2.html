        <p class="descr">During our second semester at MMI Montb√©liard, we worked on a project that allowed us to put all our acquired skills
        into practice. This project consisted of creating an innovative website on a topic we had chosen beforehand. With my two
        friends, we first brainstormed an innovative website concept, Artisae, which was approved by the judges. However, during
        the second phase, which was the website creation phase, we decided to choose another topic that better suited our skills
        and interests.</p>

                So, we created Eskiss, a website that connects parents and artists to give a second life to children's drawings. The
                concept is simple: parents upload their children's drawings onto the platform and artists can then transform them into
                unique works of art. This project allowed us to develop our creativity, design development skills, and communication
                skills.
                
                We worked hard for several weeks to bring our project to life. We created an intuitive and user-friendly interface,
                allowing users to navigate the platform easily. We also implemented a secure payment system so that parents can purchase
                the art pieces created from their children's drawings.
    
            </p>
    
            <p class="descr">
                We faced challenges during the creation of this website, but we managed to overcome them through our teamwork and
                determination. We worked closely together to ensure the quality of the website and were proud of the final result.
                
                Our experience in creating a website with Eskiss was very enriching, and we learned a lot about website creation,
                project management, and communication. We are proud of the work we accomplished, and we believe that this website can
                make a difference for parents and artists by offering them a new way to share their passion for art.
